During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I had the opportunity to work on several data analytics projects. Here are the details of the projects I worked on:

#### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to develop a model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- Model Development: Implemented various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### 2. Wine Quality Prediction
**Objective:** This project aimed to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and performed normalization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to understand relationships between different features and wine quality.
- Model Building: Used regression algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
- Model Tuning: Optimized model parameters to improve prediction accuracy.

#### 3. Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
**Objective:** The aim was to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- Feature Selection: Identified the most relevant features for predicting house prices.
- Model Implementation: Developed a Linear Regression model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#### 4. Sentiment Analysis
**Objective:** The goal was to perform sentiment analysis on a given dataset to understand the sentiment expressed in the data.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Data Cleaning: Processed text data by removing stop words, punctuations, and performing stemming/lemmatization.
- Sentiment Classification: Implemented models to classify the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the sentiment analysis model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### 5. Customer Segmentation Analysis (Task 3, Level-1)
**Objective:** This project focused on performing customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company by analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Data Cleaning: Cleaned the dataset by fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data. This step was crucial as messy data leads to unreliable outcomes.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in the data.
- Customer Segmentation: Used clustering algorithms like K-Means to group customers into distinct segments.
- Insights and Recommendations: Provided insights based on the analysis to inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

These projects have equipped me with valuable skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The experience has enhanced my ability to derive meaningful insights from data and apply various machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
